# Documentation-Images
A place to store my images that I'm using in Wiki documentation in my other repos. Not of interest in itself.

This is my workaround for the problem of including images in Wiki documentation. I will host the images in this repository, and be able to display them in the other repository via a link in Markdown format.

The other options available are not practical, or too time-consuming for what I want to do. The alternatives would be: clone the Wiki locally and upload the image to it etc... that is too long and complicated for the simple task of including an image. Likewise for doing it via a gist. I'm also not thrilled with the workaround of putting it the comments field of an issue, if for no other reason that I then don't have control over it easily if I wish to delete the image later.

Since documentation images are not strictly speaking part of the source code (only part of the documentation), I don't want to clutter up my code with an image folder.

Therefore, having a separate repository purely for images for documentation purposes is the only viable solution remaining. This repository will hold images for all my repository documentation needs, and I will keep the images in folders, one folder per repo, named in a (hopefully) meaningful way.

This repository is not likely to be of use or of interest to anyone other than myself.
